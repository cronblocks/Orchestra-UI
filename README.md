# Introduction

*Orchestra* is intended to provide an easy and lightweight interface to remote machines in order to manage remote applications' execution. In a sense it is to provide graphical and command-line interface to the remote machines for easy management. The prime reason for its existence is to handle remote Linux machines that do not have graphical environments installed for various reasons.

# Back-end

The main back-end for this project is kept in a separate [repository](https://github.com/cronblocks/Orchestra).
